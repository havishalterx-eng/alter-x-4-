# Container images

Six images cover the fourteen deployable services. `platform-web` is not here:
it ships as a static bundle, not a container.

| Image | Built from | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `node` | `Dockerfile.node` | all nine Node services |
| `ads-core`, `eval-service`, `intelligence-service`, `memory-service`, `verification-service` | `Dockerfile.python` | one Python service each |

The nine Node services share one image because they share a build and a runtime;
the five Python services do not, because each resolves its own `uv.lock`.

## Build

```bash
scripts/docker-build.sh
```

`TAG` and `REGISTRY` are environment variables, defaulting to `dev` and `alter`.
Build one image directly with:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.node -t alter/node:dev .
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.python --build-arg APP=eval-service -t alter/eval-service:dev .
```

## Run

A Node container takes its service name as the first argument, or reads
`ALTER_SERVICE_NAME`:

```bash
docker run --rm alter/node:dev platform-api
```

Any first argument that is not one of the nine names is run as a command
instead, so the same image gives a shell (`sh`) or runs a migration.

The nine names: `audit-service`, `background-workers`, `cost-ledger-service`,
`model-gateway`, `orchestration-service`, `platform-api`, `provisioning-service`,
`sandbox-service`, `tool-gateway`. The entrypoint preloads the OpenTelemetry
bootstrap for any service whose build emits one, which is what each service's Nx
`serve` target does.

A Python container runs its HTTP app by default. `eval-service` has a second
entry point -- the gRPC surface the engine dials -- reached by overriding the
command on the same image:

```bash
docker run --rm alter/eval-service:dev python -m src.grpc_server
```

## What the images do not contain

No configuration and no credentials. Every service validates its environment on
startup and resolves the rest through the config and secrets adapters, so an
image is identical across dev, staging and production and carries nothing that
identifies an environment. The bootstrap variables each service expects are
listed in `docs/specs/07-env-config-spec.md`, section 5.

Both images run as a non-root user and expect a read-only root filesystem with a
writable `/tmp`, because `infrastructure/terraform/modules/service` sets both on
every deployed task and offers no way to turn them off. A service that needs to
write elsewhere needs a mounted volume, not a relaxed image.

## Migrations

`Dockerfile.node` deliberately keeps its dev dependencies: `drizzle-kit` and
`tsx` are devDependencies and every Node migration runs through one of them, so
the same image that serves a service can migrate its database. The Python images
drop dev dependencies but keep Alembic, which is a runtime dependency.
